# Project Description

In this project we are taking movie data from various sources and using the ETL process to generate a usable dataset. Then, we create a function that handles the ETL process by taking in the raw data from three files: Wikipedia data, Kaggle metadata, and MovieLens rating data, cleaning the data, perform the appropriate transformations, and load the data into tables within Postgres SQL.
